# This bash script extracts the IDs of each case in the European Court of Human Rights and print the IDs to standard output, 
# to produce a plot of the distribution/count of different IDs in a sorted form. This is done by first calling the Python 
# script (print_kpthesaurus.py) and then the R script (analyse_and_visualize.r).
